I’ve heard from multiple people that blogging is a great for the following reasons:

- It helps you better understand the subject you’re writing about

- It creates a good habit of thinking about (and/or planning) before writing

- The blog post will most likely cover a subject/problem/issue that someone else in the community has run into

I’m at the point where I no longer consider myself a beginner and feel this it’s time to start writing and hopefully helping out.
